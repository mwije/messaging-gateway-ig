### Overview

This Implementation Guide defines a FHIR-based messaging gateway architecture 
for structured inbound and outbound message exchange.

The gateway distinguishes between:

- **[InboundCommunication](StructureDefinition-FMGInboundCommunication.html)** (Profile of Communication)
- **[OutboundCommunicationRequest](StructureDefinition-FMGOutboundCommunicationRequest.html)** (Profile of CommunicationRequest)

The design intentionally separates:
- Messages received by the gateway
- Messages to be delivered externally

### Architectural Principles

- Inbound messages are immutable records.
- Outbound messages are request-driven orchestration artifacts.
- Attachments are used as the message payload mechanism.

### Scope

This guide focuses exclusively on:
- Message transport modeling
- Payload handling
- Delivery tracking

It does not define:
- Clinical workflows
- Domain-specific content models

### Status

Draft (CI Build)

### FHIR Version Compatibility

This Implementation Guide is authored against **FHIR R4 (4.0.1)** and is intentionally designed to remain compatible with R4B and R5 where structural alignment is maintained. Validation for this publication is performed against FHIR R4.

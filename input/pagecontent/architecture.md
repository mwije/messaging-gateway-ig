## Architecture

### Overview

The gateway distinguishes between two distinct message directions:

- **[InboundMessage](StructureDefinition-FMGInboundCommunication.html)**
  FMGInboundCommunication (Profile of Communication)

- **[OutboundMessageRequest](StructureDefinition-FMGOutboundCommunicationRequest.html)** 
  FMGOutboundCommunicationRequest (Profile of CommunicationRequest)

This separation enforces clear semantic boundaries:

- Inbound messages represent facts.
- Outbound messages represent intent.

---

### Architectural Model

#### External System → Gateway (Inbound)

External systems submit messages to the gateway.

These are recorded as:

- [Communication]({{site.data.fhir.path}} | append 'communication.html') resources
- Conforming to the FMGInboundCommunication profile
- Immutable after successful persistence

Inbound messages represent the event:

> “A message was received by the gateway.”

They SHALL NOT be used to initiate outbound delivery.

---

#### Internal Processing

Upon reception, the gateway SHALL persist the message in an internal database.

The internal storage model is implementation-specific and outside the scope of this guide.

FHIR resources represent the integration boundary only.

---

#### Outbound Scheduling Semantics

Outbound delivery may occur:

- **Immediate Delivery**  
  `occurrenceDateTime` not specified.

- **Scheduled Delivery**  
  `occurrenceDateTime` specifies when the gateway may initiate delivery.

This element represents the earliest allowed dispatch time.

---

#### Gateway → External System (Outbound)

Outbound messages are modeled as:

- [CommunicationRequest]({{site.data.fhir.path}} | append 'communicationrequest.html')
- Conforming to the FMGOutboundCommunicationRequest profile

These represent the directive:

> “A message must be delivered.”

They undergo lifecycle transitions reflecting delivery orchestration.

---

### Design Principles

#### Directional Exclusivity

| Direction | Resource Type |
|------------|----------------|
| Inbound | Communication |
| Outbound | CommunicationRequest |

Rules:

- Communication SHALL NOT be used for outbound delivery.
- CommunicationRequest SHALL NOT be used for inbound recording.

---

#### Identifier Policy

Business identifiers SHALL be used for external correlation.

FHIR resource `id` values are considered technical identifiers 
and SHALL NOT be relied upon for cross-system reconciliation.

Within transaction Bundles, `urn:uuid` MAY be used for intra-Bundle referencing.

---

#### Payload Strategy

Payload SHALL be represented using `Attachment`.

Supported content includes:

- Structured JSON
- XML
- Binary documents (PDF, images, etc.)
- Encrypted payloads

The gateway does not constrain attachment content semantics.

---

#### Lifecycle Separation

Inbound and outbound flows have independent lifecycle models.

##### Inbound (Communication.status)

- completed
- entered-in-error

Inbound messages do not support intermediate delivery states.

##### Outbound (CommunicationRequest.status)

- draft
- active (**eligible for delivery**)
- on-hold (temporarily suspended)
- revoked (delivery cancelled or was unsuccessful)
- completed (successfully dispatched)
- entered-in-error (technical error)

Status transitions reflect delivery control, not payload mutation.

---

### Conformance Expectations

Implementations SHALL:

- Conform to the defined profiles
- Preserve attachment integrity
- Support Bundle-based submission
- Ensure idempotent processing
- Prefer business identifiers over literal resource IDs  
  (Exception: intra-Bundle referencing via `urn:uuid`)

---

### Out of Scope

This guide does not define:

- Clinical workflows
- Business payload schemas
- Transport-layer security
- Endpoint discovery mechanisms

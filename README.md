## Overview

This Implementation Guide defines a FHIR-based messaging gateway architecture 
for structured inbound and outbound message exchange.

The gateway distinguishes between:

- **[InboundCommunication](https://mwije.github.io/fhir-messaging-gateway-ig/StructureDefinition-FMGInboundCommunication.html)** (Profile of Communication)
- **[OutboundCommunicationRequest](https://mwije.github.io/fhir-messaging-gateway-ig/StructureDefinition-FMGOutboundCommunicationRequest.html)** (Profile of CommunicationRequest)

The design intentionally separates:

- Messages received by the gateway
- Messages to be delivered externally

### Architectural Principles

- Inbound messages are immutable records.
- Outbound messages are request-driven orchestration artifacts.
- Attachments are used as the message payload mechanism.

### Scope

This guide focuses exclusively on:

- Message transport modeling
- Payload handling
- Delivery tracking

It does **not** define:

- Clinical workflows
- Domain-specific content models


## FHIR Version Compatibility

Authored against **FHIR R4 (4.0.1)** and intentionally designed to remain compatible with **R4B and R5**. Validation is performed against FHIR R4.


## Build & Validation

This project leverages **SUSHI**, **FHIR IG Publisher**, and an IG template to generate and validate the Implementation Guide automatically.  

GitHub Actions CI workflow:

1. Runs **SUSHI** to generate FHIR artifacts from FSH files
2. Runs **FHIR IG Publisher** for validation and site generation
3. Deploys the published IG to **GitHub Pages**  

You can trigger the workflow by pushing changes to the `main` branch. The **Build badge** above reflects the current CI status.

> Note: Only source files (`*.fsh`, `*.md`, examples) should be edited. Generated output is handled automatically.


## Profiles Overview

| Profile | Base Resource | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| InboundMessage | Communication | Represents messages received by the gateway |
| OutboundMessageRequest | CommunicationRequest | Represents outbound delivery requests |


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome via pull requests. Please:

- Fork the repository
- Update FSH source files (`input/*.fsh`) or documentation
- Ensure CI validation passes before merging

The **published IG** is automatically generated from the source files and updated via GitHub Pages.
